## 📡 API Integration  

SkyCast uses a weather API to fetch real-time data. Update the API key in the `.env` file:  

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory.  
2. Add your API key:  
   ```env  
   VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  
   VITE_WEATHER_API_URL=https://api.example.com  
   ```  

> Replace `your_api_key_here` with your weather API key and `https://api.example.com` with the Swagger API endpoint.
